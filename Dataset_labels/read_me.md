We would like to thank our co-author, Dr. David Sholl, and his colleague, Dr. Raghuram Thyagarajan, for their work in compiling the PIMs database and performing the single-component adsorption isotherm simulations. 

PIM_ExpFeatures.csv contains the physicochemical features for each of the 75 PIMs that were used during this study. Density is in units of g/mL, pore limiting diameter (PLD), and limiting cavity diameter (LCD) are both in units of Ã…, and the N<sub>2</sub> accessible surface area (ASA) is in units of m <sup>2</sup>/g
