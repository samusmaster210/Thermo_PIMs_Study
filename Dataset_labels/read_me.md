We would like to thank our co-author, Dr. David Sholl, and his colleague, Dr. Raghuram Thyagarajan, for their work in compiling the PIMs database and performing the single-component adsorption isotherm simulations. 

PIM_ExpFeatures.csv contains the physicochemical features for each of the 75 PIMs that were used during this study. Density is in units of g/mL, pore limiting diameter (PLD), and limiting cavity diameter (LCD) are both in units of Ã…, and the N<sub>2</sub> accessible surface area (ASA) is in units of m<sup>2</sup>/g.

The first column of PIM_ExpFeatures.csv contains each material's ID, and the last column is from which that material originates. These ID numbers can be cross-referenced with the structures in Figure 4 of this study (Thermodynamic Labeling Enables CO<sub>2</sub> Prediction in Polymers of Intrinsic Microporosity Under Small Data Constraints). The second to the seventh columns contain the atom counts (C, H, O, N, F, S) for each feature, and the System_Size feature in the eighth column is their sum. Columns 9-11 are the materials' supercell angles. 

The twelfth column describes each material's
