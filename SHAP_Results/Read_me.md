This directory houses the SHAP results of the study. The SHAP_values.csv file contains the individual SHAP scores for each material and their features. These were aggregated for each descriptor by calculating the average magnitude across the 75 PIMs, and are reported in the SHAP_feature_ranking.csv files. This allowed us to determine how each feature affects the models' predictions for the entire dataset, and the values are reported in Table 2 of this study (Thermodynamic Labeling Enables CO<sub>2</sub>sub> Prediction in Polymers of Intrinsic Microporosity Under Small Data Constraints), while the graphs are available in the Supporting Information section 4.
