# Predicting Qst Thermodynamics for PIMs

Porous polymers, particularly polymers of intrinsic microporosity (PIMs), combine high surface areas with tunable functionalities, positioning them as promising materials for post-combustion CO₂ capture technologies. A key physical parameter of these materials is the isosteric heat of adsorption (Qₛₜ), which quantifies the interaction strength between CO₂ molecules and the polymer framework. In this work, we demonstrate that data-driven models constructed from computationally determined physicochemical descriptors can accurately predict Qst at room temperature using a modestly sized dataset of 75 PIMs. By optimizing model parameters through Bayesian methods and interpreting feature importance using SHAP analysis, we identify the molecular characteristics that most strongly influence the prediction of CO2-PIMs isosteric heats of adsorption. These results demonstrate that accurate predictive workflows can be developed using relatively small datasets. Such workflows can accelerate the design of polymeric adsorbents by identifying key molecular descriptors that correlate with the isosteric heat of adsorption. Overall, this adaptable methodology can be extended to other gas‐separation challenges, helping pave the way for faster discovery of advanced polymeric membranes for capturing CO₂.
