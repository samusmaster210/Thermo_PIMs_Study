This folder contains the scripts used in this study to benchmark various AI algorithms for predicting the isosteric heats of adsorption of PIMs with CO<sub>2</sub>. The code is saved as .py files and can be used by these commands:  


<pre><code>conda activate "ENV_NAME"</code></pre>

<pre><code>python "FILE_NAME.py" python=3.9.22</code></pre>

When the code is used, a new directory is created that stores the hyperparameters and model results.
